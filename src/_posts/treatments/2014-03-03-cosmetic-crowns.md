title:  Cosmetic Crowns
excerpt: It is now possible to construct crowns (caps) for teeth that blend in perfectly with your natural teeth. The pictures show a gentleman who had a poor NHS crown for 30 years. Using cutting edge techniques and an exceptional laboratory, we were able to construct a new crown that was a perfect match to the natural tooth.

We've also added a lot of different settings for [Redcarpet][redcarpet],
including being able to ^superscript, _underline_, ==highlight==,
~~strikethrough~~, and footnotes.[^1] It even automatically makes links into
URLs: www.jekyllrb.com and you can put multiple underscores in words without
them leaning all over the place: this_word_has_underscores. It'll also make your
quotes look nice, like this: "hoho", your dashes and hypens will be dashing too:
---/--.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
