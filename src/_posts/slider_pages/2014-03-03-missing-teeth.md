title: Missing teeth?
excerpt: In many situations dental implants are the best way to replace a missing tooth or teeth, as this is the closest that you can get to having your own tooth back again as well as being much more comfortable than a denture.

Dental implants are essentially an artificial root that is placed into the gum which can then support a new tooth (crown) or be used to help hold a denture in place. When we are planning to place implants we take a state of the art 3D CBCT Scan which we will then use to place the implant in the ideal position. Depending on what we see in the scan it may even be possible to place the new tooth on the same day as the implant is placed. When well placed and well looked after implants can last an incredibly long time and are not susceptible to decay.
