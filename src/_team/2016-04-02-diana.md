Diana is a hugely experienced dentist, originally from Columbia, she moved to the North West after meeting an irish man! Columbia's loss is our gain, as Diana is a truly outstanding dentist who provides top quality treatments and is further enhancing her skills by completing a Masters in Restorative and Aesthetic Dentistry through Manchester University. Diana is a fanatical Irish rugby fan and attends as many matches as she can.
